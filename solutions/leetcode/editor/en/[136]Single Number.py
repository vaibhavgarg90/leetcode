# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except 
# for one. Find that single one. 
# 
#  You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only 
# constant extra space. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: nums = [2,2,1]
# Output: 1
#  Example 2: 
#  Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
# Output: 4
#  Example 3: 
#  Input: nums = [1]
# Output: 1
#  
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10⁴ 
#  -3 * 10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10⁴ 
#  Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears 
# only once.
