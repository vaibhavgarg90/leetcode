# Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the 
# tree. 
# 
#  The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any 
# two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root. 
# 
#  The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges 
# between them. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,2]
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  -100 <= Node.val <= 100
