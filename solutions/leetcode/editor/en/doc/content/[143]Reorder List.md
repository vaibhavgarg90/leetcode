# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented 
# as: 
# 
#  
# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
#  
# 
#  Reorder the list to be on the following form: 
# 
#  
# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
#  
# 
#  You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may 
# be changed. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,4,2,3]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10⁴]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 1000
