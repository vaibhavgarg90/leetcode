# Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of 
# the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [], val = 1
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
# Output: []
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥]. 
#  1 <= Node.val <= 50 
#  0 <= val <= 50
