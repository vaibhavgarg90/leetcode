# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes 
# in the tree. 
# 
#  According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe lowest common ancestor 
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p 
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).‚Äù 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant 
# of itself according to the LCA definition.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
# Output: 1
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  -10‚Åπ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  All Node.val are unique. 
#  p != q 
#  p and q will exist in the tree.
