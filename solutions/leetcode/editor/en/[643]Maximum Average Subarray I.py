# You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements, and an integer 
# k. 
# 
#  Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to k that has the maximum 
# average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less 
# than 10‚Åª‚Åµ will be accepted. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
# Output: 12.75000
# Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
# 
#  
# Input: nums = [5], k = 1
# Output: 5.00000
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  n == nums.length 
#  1 <= k <= n <= 10‚Åµ 
#  -10‚Å¥ <= nums[i] <= 10‚Å¥
